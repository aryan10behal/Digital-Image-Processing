# Digital-Image-Processing

--> Transformation_on_Image.py

The whole code has 3 functions.
  1. To extrapolate an image.
  2. To apply any combination of Translation, Rotation, Scaling on image.
  3. TO get back the original Image.


How to Run the code?

--> Run the code on your local python IDE.
--> Enter the location of the image you wish to work on.
--> Enter the values of your transormations.
--> RUN the code...

( For Getting back image, you need to manually find 3 points in reference image and their corresponding transformation in output image.. and then build the X and V matrix to tranform output image back to input image to check it with reference image....)
